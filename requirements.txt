# This file lists the Python packages required for the To-Do List application.
# The current application uses only standard Python libraries (like 'os' and 'unittest')
# and therefore has no external dependencies listed.

# If you were using a framework like Flask or a testing library like pytest, 
# you would list it here, for example:
Flask==2.3.2
pytest==7.4.3
